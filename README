Need:
-----
Ability to securely store password locally on machine

	
Approach:
---------
Encrypted result is stored in file whose name is stored in a directory structure of owner/userid/instance


Assumptions:
------------
Security: Access to host-key file is necessary to decrypt 



*** NOTICE *** Implementation for windows is barebones/minimal and effectively has
no security at this time. This implementation is purely for convenience of keeping the
code the same on unix and windows, and to keep passwords out of script source files. 
Contributions of a more appropriate implementation on windows that leverages filesystem
security or secure credential store would be ideal, but need to maintain the same calling
conventions.

External Dependencies:
----------------------
Links against openssl libssl and libcrypto to obtain blowfish library.

Windows Builds:
---------------
Install nullsoft installer 2.46
Install Mingw from sourceforge (0.6.2-beta-20131004-1)
	Choose mingw-developer-toolkit, mingw32-base, msys-base
	Create a C:\work directory
	Create C:\mingw\msys\1.0\etc\fstab file containing
		C:\mingw /mingw
		C:\work /work
	Create shortcut on desktop to run:
		C:\mingw\msys\1.0\msys.bat
		Start In: C:\mingw\msys\1.0
	Launch that shortcut to bring up shell
	mingw-get install msys-libopenssl	
	mingw-get install msys-vim
	# Need to get openssl libs into include paths searched by mingw defaults
	ln -s /include/* /mingw/include/
	# Alias for 'vi filename' usage
	ln -s /bin/vim.exe /bin/vi.exe

Check out and build authsrv
	cd /work
	git clone https://github.com/unixtools/authsrv
	cd authsrv
	make

Build the installer
	Browse to C:/work in windows UI
	Right click on the NSI file in authsrv/windows/authsrv.nsi and choose to compile
	or run the 'makeinstaller.bat' file


Linux Builds:
-------------
Install has a dependency on libopenssl-devel, so please install that first.
Check out and build authsrv

cd /work
git clone https://github.com/unixtools/authsrv
cd authsrv
make
sudo make install
sudo make key


Devel Notes:
------------
Version Number is embedded in top level Makefile, authsrv.spec and windows/authsrv.nsi
